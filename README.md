Magnetic-and-electric-forces-study
==========================

This is a project developped in Java, with the purpose of studying, analysing and testing the effects of magnetic and electric forces in a charged particle.

The Coulombs Law is the basis of this project, where the attraction or repulsion of a charged particle are the forces generated by the electric current or the magnetic field. There is a window inside the program specifying more information.

In a "developper" point of view. This software consist in a simple Java software. Developed using NetBeans, the GUI is designed using the JFrame and similar components.
